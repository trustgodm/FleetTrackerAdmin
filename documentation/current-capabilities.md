## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Queries (Using Existing Schema)

```sql
-- Get active vehicles
SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE status = 'in_use';

-- Get trips for a vehicle
SELECT * FROM trips WHERE vehicle_id = ? ORDER BY start_time DESC;

-- Get maintenance due
SELECT * FROM maintenance_schedules WHERE next_due_date <= CURRENT_DATE;

-- Get fuel consumption
SELECT 
  vehicle_id,
  SUM(fuel_level_start - fuel_level_end) as total_consumption
FROM trips 
WHERE end_time IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY vehicle_id;

-- Get department statistics
SELECT 
  d.name,
  COUNT(v.id) as vehicle_count,
  COUNT(u.id) as user_count
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN vehicles v ON d.id = v.department_id
LEFT JOIN users u ON d.id = u.department_id
GROUP BY d.id, d.name;
```
